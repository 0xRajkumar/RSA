# RSA

I have implemented the RSA encryption algorithm in Rust and used the primal library to check whether a number is prime or not. Additionally, the rand library is used for generating random numbers.

## Generate private and public key

```
cargo run gen
```

## To Encrypt

```
cargo run en
```

## To Decrypt

```
cargo run de
```
